\textbf{b) Interpret the estimated slope coefficients from regression 1 and 2, that is $\hat{\beta}$1, $\hat{\beta}$2, $\hat{\beta}$3, $\hat{\alpha}$1, $\hat{\alpha}$2, $\hat{\alpha}$3 and $\hat{\alpha}$4.}

In regression 1 the coefficient for BEDRMS means that each additional bedroom added to a house decreases the home price by $238,073.10$, holding all other variables constant. The coefficient for BATHRMS means that each additional bathroom added to a house increases the home price by $117,916.30$, holding all other variables constant. The coefficient for SQFT means that each additional square foot added to a house increases the home price by $377.12$, holding all other variables constant. In regression 2 the coefficient for BEDRMS means that each additional bedroom added to a house decreases the home price by $228,726.20$, holding all other variables constant. The coefficient for BATHRMS means that each additional bathroom added to a house increases the home price by $116,538.10$, holding all other variables constant. The coefficient for SQFT means that each additional square foot added to a house increases the home price by $365.89$, holding all other variables constant. The coefficient for YEAR means that each additional year added to the age of the house decreases the home price by $891.56$, holding all other variables constant.


\section*{}
\textbf{c) Are any of the estimated slope coefficients in equation 2 significantly different from zero on a 5\% level? 10\% level? 1\% level? Explain.}
\subsection*{}
In order to see if a slope coefficient is significantly different from 0 we do a hypothesis test. To preform a hypothesis test. We create two different hypotheses, the Null Hypothesis, Ho, and the Alternative Hypothesis, Ha. We usually let the null hypothesis represent the values that we do not expect. So in this case my Hull Hypothesis is $\alpha$ = 0 because I don't expect the slope efficient to equal 0. So if the Null Hypothesis proves to be not true or I reject the Null Hypothesis that means that $\alpha$ is significantly different from 0.

\section*{}
\textbf{d) Is $\hat{\beta}$1 different from $\hat{\alpha}$1? Did you expect it to be different? Explain why or why not.}
\subsection*{}
$\hat{\beta}$1 is $9346.9$ more than $\hat{\alpha}$1. Yes this is to be expected since we included the YEAR variable in regression 2 but not regression 1. Some of the effect the YEAR variable has on the price of a home was being captures by the BEDRMS variable in model 1 but now that we included the YEAR variable in model 2 BEDRMS decreases because it is no longer capturing some of the data of the YEAR variable. 

\section*{}
\textbf{e) Using the estimates from regression 2, predict the price of a house that has 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 1500 square feet in area and is 60 years old.}
\subsection*{}
$\hat{price}$ = $313,019.00$ - 228,726.20$\hat{bedrms}$ + 116,538.10$\hat{bathrms}$ + 365.89$\hat{sqft}$ - 891.56$\hat{year}$ 
$\hat{price}$ = 126,535.76

\section*{}
\textbf{f) Using the estimates from regression 2, predict the price of a house that has 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, 600 square feet and is 118 years old. Does the predicted price make sense? Explain why/why not.}
\subsection*{}
$\hat{price}$ = 86,433.56 
Yes, this prediction does make sense. A home of that size would most likely be a small condo of some kind. Which probably would not cost a lot of money. The predicted price is 86,433.56 which in terms of home prices is very afforded. The price seems to line up with the size of the home so it does make sense.   

\section*{}
\textbf{g) Is the effect of the variable years on price causal? Why/why not?}
\subsection*{}
No, the effect of YEAR on PRICE is not causal. According to model 2, a home that has 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, is 1500 square ft, and is 118 years old should cost 21, 330.62. That price is an unrealistic value for a home. If I take the same criteria and use it in model 1, that home should cost 539,380.50 which is a more realistic price for a home with that criteria.  Because the YEAR variable causes the price to become unrealistic this example means that the effect of YEAR on PRICE is not causal. 

\section*{}
\textbf{h) Could you and is it a good idea to use the regression result of equation 2 to predict the price of a house in another city? Why/why not?}
\subsection*{}
No, you can’t use the results for equation 2 for one city to predict the price of a home in another city. The main reason you can’t use the same results is that there are too many variables that we did not control for in the equation that could have a significant effect on home prices. For example, the Equation does not control for demographics of that city, the average crime rate of that city, average property tax for that city, and average lot size for that city. Each one of those variables could have a significant effect on home prices and the data for those variables will change from city to city. These uncontrolled factors are the reasons why you can’t use the results of equation 2 for one city to predict home prices in another city.  

\section*{}
\textbf{i) Suggest two other variables that you would like to include in the regression to explain the house price. Comment on why you would include those variables. Specify two hypotheses using Ho and Ha to test the hypothesized effect of these two variables.}
\subsection*{}
The two variables I would add a variable for lot size and a variable for home elevation to the equation. I would choose lots size because while square footage of a home is important in determining price it doesn’t tell you how much land the home is on. For example, a 1000 square foot home built on 2 areas of land will be worth more than a 100 square foot home built on half an acre of land. I would choose home elevation because it has been my experience that homes that are built higher up on a hill or mountain are usually priced higher than homes built on a lower elevation. I want to measure this and see if home elevation really has an effect on home price. My hypothesis for lot size would be Ho =< 0 and Ha > 0. I chose this hypothesis because I believe as lot size increases, it will have a positive effect on PRICE. My hypothesis for elevation would be Ho =< 0 and Ha > 0. The reason I chose this hypothesis is that I believe as elevation increases it will have a positive effect on PRICE.
